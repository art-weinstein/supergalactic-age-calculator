## Technologies Used

* HTML
* CSS
* JavaScript

## Description
  This program takes a user age, and returns to them a planet based age (Mecury, Venus, Mars and Jupiter). The program takes into account the global average human lifespan rounded up (80 years), and tells the user roughly how long they would have left to live for each planet's year. If the user happens to be above the age of the average human lifespan, the program returns to them how much longer they have lived in each of the planet's years. As of now, there is only styling and JS code, user interface logic has yet to be applied.
